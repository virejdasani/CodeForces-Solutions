### 112 A. Petya and Strings

# Store input and set strings to lowercase
str1 = input().lower()
str2 = input().lower()

# Compare strings
if str1 < str2:
    print(-1)
elif str1 > str2:
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)

# Little Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size 
# for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. 
# Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' 
# case does not matter, that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to 
# the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.

# Input

# Each of the first two lines contains a bought string. The strings' lengths 
# range from 1 to 100 inclusive. It is guaranteed that the strings are of the 
# same length and also consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.

# Output

# If the first string is less than the second one, print "-1". If the second 
# string is less than the first one, print "1". If the strings are equal, print 
# "0". Note that the letters' case is not taken into consideration when the 
# strings are compared.
